## Ingredients
- 2 Onions
- A bit of parsley
- Some mushrooms
- 1 cup of rissotto rice
- 100ml white wine
- vegetable broth
- butter
- parmesan
- pepper
- salt

## How to do it
Cut the onions, parsley, mushrooms before starting.

### Rice
1. Add half of your onions to the pot.
2. Saute the onions with some butter.
3. Once they have a glass-like color, add the rice.
4. When the rice also has a bit of a glass-like color, deglaze everything with white wine.
5. Add a ladle of vegetable broth and turn the heat down a little.
6. Once the vegetable broth has evaporated, add another ladle of vegetable and repeat that until the rice is well-cooked.
7. Add a bit of butter to the rice
8. Once the butter is mixed in, add quite a lot of parmesan chesse and some pepper and salt.

### Mushrooms
1. Add the other half of your onions to a pan.
2. Saute the onions with some butter.
3. Once they have a glass-like color, add the mushrooms.
4. After some time, add some parsley.

### Finishing up
Serve it! I usually put the rissoto on the plate, add the mushrooms on top, some more parmesan on top, and then a bit of parsley for the aesthetic and if you have it some basil and olive oil mixture (will also add a simple recipe soon™️)
